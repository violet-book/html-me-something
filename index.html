        <p id="firstuse">City Pop Love</p></div></h3>
        </div> City pop is a genre of music from Japan. Combining funk, pop, and jazz-fusion, those in the city pop genre created unique music with a distinctly "urban" feel. City pop came about in the late 70's and continued on through the 80's. Many would say city pop as a genre is dead, but it lives today through new fans and beautiful discoveries.</p1>

<p2>In Japan, city pop originated as simply part of the pop genre. These songs were no different from anything else. They faded into obscurity, with many new generations having never heard these songs. Many termed them "old people's music" or "my parents' music". However, due to a new surge in listeners from around the world in the 2010's, these songs take on a new life. These new listeners categorized the genre as "city pop", or "music that makes you feel like you're riding in a convertible at night in 1980's Tokyo."</p2>

<p3>Let's dive into city pop, and hear what is delighting new fans from around the world.</p3>

<article><h2>1. "Plastic Love" by Mariya Takeuchi</h2>

<h3>Dancing to the Plastic Beat</h3>
<p4>By far the #1 song in the city pop genre is "Plastic Love". It is many fans' introduction to the genre. It encompasses everything the genre is about, the classic city pop song. Created in 1984, "Plastic Love" is about a woman who dances the night away in a disco in order to starve her loneliness. It is a song which everyone can relate to, and thus its popularity. Since it is the gateway for many city pop fans, the song is considered the mother of the city pop genre.</p4>
<h2>2. "Last Summer Whisper" by Anri</h2>

<h3>Baby, Love Me Again</h3>
<p5>If "Plastic Love" is the gateway to city pop, "Last Summer Whisper" is the second breath. Anri is the undisputed Queen of City Pop, having given us many classics of the genre. This is her most popular song, and its easy to see why. Debuting in 1982, it is about a girl who has broken up with her lover, and her longing to see them again. It is a song which calls upon many images of what everyone loves about city pop: the sea, summer nights, summer rain. This song causes many fans to associate the genre with the summer at its end. Anri sings about these summer themes again and again, and this song is credited with starting the association with these themes. Therefore, it is the architect of the genre.</p5>
<h2>3. "Dress Down" by Kaoru Akimoto</h2>

<h3>Dress Down!</h3>
<p6></p6>Released in 1986, "Dress Down" is a treasure to fans. So aggressively 1980's in sound, it furthers fan fantasies that they are really there in 1980's Japan. The song is about a girl who misses her lover, and is getting undressed after a long night. 
<h2>4. "Stay with Me" by Miki Mastsubara</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Dx3zuha4-0" > alt = courtesy Ikkongchi, Pony Canyon</iframe>
<h3>To You, Yes My Love, to You</h3>
<p7>These words, "Yes my love, to you" are what every city pop fan thinks when they hear the name "Miki Matsubara". A young talent in the late 70's, Miki would go on to record "Stay with Me" in 1979. One of the oldest tracks in the city pop genre, it is credited with starting the movement of Japanese pop bringing jazz and funk into the mix, and therefore thrusting Japanese music as a whole into the modern era. Rediscovery by city pop fans was just the icing on the cake, and we remember and worship this wonderful woman every time we press "play".</p7>
<h2>5. "Midnight Pretenders" by Tomoko Aran</h2>

<h3>Every time I Wish...</h3>
<p8>Recorded in 1983, Tomoko Aran's "Midnight Pretenders" set everyone's dial to permanent "chill". Not much is known about this artist, but her impact on city pop can't be disputed. Widely considered for setting the tone of city pop, Tomoko Aran is one of the most important city pop artists for fans. </p8>
<h2>6. "Dance in the Memories" by Meiko Nakahara</h2>

<h3>I Just Dance in the Sweet Memories</h3>
<p10>Released in 1988, "Dance in the Memories" was used as an ending song for the popular anime "Kimagure Orange Road." Due to this, many city pop fans who are also anime fans already knew of the song. However, with its rebirth in the city pop genre, many are looking at the song in a different light, with new appreciation. With its crisp and classic use of synthesizers, this song puts us all right back in the 80's, even if some of us weren't born yet.</p10>
<h2>7. "Watashitachi o Shinjite Ite" by Cindy</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ak_dM2EHKE" > alt = courtesy BetoCrazy, copyright Sony Entertainment Music Japan </iframe>
<h3>Aka "Angel Touch"</h3>
<p11>Cindy was a composer much ahead of her time. As a fantastic singer already established, she went on to write the very songs city pop lovers adore by other singers. A multi-talented lady with dreams of becoming big in the west, Cindy would pass away of cancer at a young age, before those dreams were realized. If only she were alive today to see that she finally achieved that dream: as a goddess for us western city pop lovers.</p11>
<h2>8. "Mystical Composer" by Momoko Kikuchi</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgQP0ZlOvQM" > alt = courtesy Orchid Enterprises, copyright VAP</iframe>
<h3>Waiting For You</h3>
<p12>At the tender age of 17, Momoko Kikuchi recorded one of the best city pop albums of all time in 1986: "Adventure". "Mystical Composer", the song every city pop fan knows, is like the bread in city pop's peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It will always be there, bopping along in our hearts, holding up the rest of city pop until the end of time.</p12>
<h2>9. "I Love You So" by Junko Ohashi</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2QUngVGxmE" > alt = courtesy Noah Gonzalez, copyright Phillips</iframe>
<h3>I Love You So Oh Oh Oh</h3>
<p13>In 1984, Junko Ohashi was already a well established artist. However, the album "Magical" propelled her into superstardom. Many years later, Junko Ohashi has more city pop hits than any other artist in the genre. Any Junko Ohashi song is gold, but "I Love You So" is often the first that city pop fans hear and therefore it is what causes them to fall in love with her.</p13>
<h2>10. "Tasogare" by Mai Yamane"</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IhCDK_pSjnk" > alt = courtesy TheAMuseum, copyright Teichiku Records</iframe>
<h3>Simply, Tasogare</h3>
<p14>Covered many times by city pop artists, the original "Tasogare" recorded in 1980 can never be beat. Mai Yamane is already well known by anime fans worldwide for her unique and recognizable voice, and her involvement in many beloved shows. However, her earlier work was very much a mystery until city pop fans started to find her older albums in used records stores. And what was found was magic, and a new, profound understanding for this beloved artist was born.</p14>
<h2>Bonus: "Christmas Eve" by Tatsuro Yamashita</h2>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYP_1MZyWBM" > alt = courtesy OH IN of Youtube, copyright WMG</iframe>
<h3>Silent Night, Holy Night!</h3>
<p>No city pop list would be complete without "Christmas Eve" by Tatsuro Yamashita. Considered the father of city pop, Tatsuro Yamashita is often the producer on many of our beloved city pop tracks. He is also Mariya Takeuchi's husband, and together, they are considered the definitive city pop couple. Released in 1993, "Christmas Eve" is a song heard all over Japan during the Christmas season, from malls to train stations, and has found its forever place in many a city pop fan's heart.</p>
